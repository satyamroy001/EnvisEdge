**Note** : Only FEMNIST dataset has been implemented till now.

To download the FEMNIST dataset follow the following steps:

```bash
chmod +x download.sh
```

```bash
bash download.sh -f
```
The above command will save the data inside data folder (which is meant to be a dictionary of all datasets).
