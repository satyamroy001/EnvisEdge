A one-stop solution to build your recommendation models, train them and,
deploy them in a privacy-preserving manner– right on the users’ devices.

EnvisEdge allows you to easily explore new federated learning algorithms
and deploy them into production.

The steps to building an awesome recommendation system are: 

* 🔩 **Standard ML training**: Pick up any ML model and benchmark it using standard settings.
* 🎮 **Federated Learning Simulation**: Once you are satisfied with your model, explore a host of FL algorithms with the simulator.
* 🏭 **Industrial Deployment**: After all the testing and simulation, deploy easily using NimbleEdge suite
* 🚀 **Edge Computing**: Leverage all the benefits of edge computing
