Contributing Guidelines
=======================

We are always eager to work with new contributors, engage with them and
build exciting technologies. This library allows you to train your
recommendation models on user devices and is the core SDK that gets
deployed across millions of users.

Here are some important resources to get ready for contributing:

-  `Introduction to Federated
   Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629>`__ gives a brief
   introduction to the space and sets the basic terminology
-  `Deploying Federated Learning at
   scale <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01046>`__ explains how a scalable
   FL system can be built
-  `NimbleEdge Tutorials <./docs>`__ is an overview of the library and
   our architecture

Testing
-------

The library is in the initial stages and we would like to build a
complete suite of tests. Till then we can only test functionality

Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

Please send a `GitHub Pull Request to
EnvisEdge <https://github.com/NimbleEdge/EnvisEdge>`__ with a clear list
of what you’ve done (read more about `pull
requests <http://help.github.com/pull-requests/>`__). Please Squash your
commits into one before sending the pull request.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are
fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

::

   $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
   > 
   > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Coding conventions
------------------

-  Please use the autopep-8 reformat **on the VCS changes** before the
   final commit.
-  Ensure indentation consistency
-  Follow Google code style
-  Please follow numpy style guides
   `here <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__.

Documentation
-------------

- The Design of documentation is based on `MLflow <https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html>`__
